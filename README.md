approach 1
Create an Adjacency List: First, the given edges are used to create an adjacency list representation of the graph. This representation helps in storing the connections between vertices efficiently. The graph is undirected, so for each edge [u, v], we add v to the list of neighbors of u and vice versa.

Depth-First Search (DFS): The DFS function is recursively called to traverse the graph starting from the source vertex. It marks each visited vertex and explores its neighbors. If the current vertex is the destination, it returns True, indicating that a path from the source to the destination exists. Otherwise, it continues the traversal until all possible paths are explored.

Visited Array: A visited array is used to keep track of vertices that have been visited during the traversal. This prevents visiting the same vertex multiple times and avoids infinite loops in cyclic graphs.

Return Result: Finally, the result of the DFS function is returned, indicating whether there exists a valid path from the source to the destination.
The time complexity of this approach is O(N + E)

approach 2
The function longestCycle iterates through each node of the graph and performs a depth-first search from each node to find cycles.
For each node, a DFS is initiated with additional parameters: node (current node being visited), start (starting node of the current DFS traversal), and depth (current depth of traversal).
During DFS, if the current node is visited and matches the starting node (i.e., a cycle is detected), the function updates the max_length variable to store the maximum cycle length found.
The algorithm utilizes a visited array to keep track of nodes visited during the DFS traversal, allowing backtracking and detection of cycles.
Finally, after exploring all nodes, the function returns the maximum cycle length found or -1 if no cycle is detected.
the overall time complexity of the solution is O(N^2)

approaach 3
Sort Connections by Cost:

Start by sorting the connections based on their costs in ascending order. This allows for an efficient selection of edges with lower costs.
Union-Find Data Structure:

Initialize a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure. This data structure is used to efficiently determine whether adding an edge will create a cycle in the graph.
Iterate through Sorted Connections:

For each connection (edge) in the sorted order:
Check if adding this connection between two cities will create a cycle in the graph using the Union-Find data structure.
If adding the connection doesn't create a cycle, merge the two cities (union operation) and add the cost of the connection to the total minimum cost.
Keep track of the number of edges added to the MST.
Check Connectivity:

After processing all connections, check if the number of edges added to the MST is equal to N - 1, where N is the number of cities.
If the number of edges added is N - 1, it means all cities are connected, and the minimum cost to connect them is the sum of the edge costs in the MST. Return this minimum cost.
If the number of edges added is not N - 1, it indicates that it's impossible to connect all cities, so return -1.

The time complexity of this approach is O(E log E)

approach 4
Depth-First Search (DFS):

The solution employs a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to explore all paths from the source node (0) to the target node (n - 1) in the given DAG.
It starts DFS from the source node (0) and explores its neighbors one by one.
During the traversal, it keeps track of the current path being explored.
Backtracking:

At each step of the DFS traversal:
If the current node is the target node (n - 1), it means a path from the source to the target has been found. This path is added to the result.
For each neighbor of the current node, it appends the neighbor to the current path and recursively explores paths from that neighbor.
After exploring paths from a neighbor, it backtracks by removing the last node from the path to explore other possible paths.
Result Accumulation:

As paths from source to target are found during the DFS traversal, they are added to the result list.

The time complexity can be O(2^N) in the worst case
